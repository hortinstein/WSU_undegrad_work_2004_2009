   other needed files from Victor.

2. Run the mk script to generate mtx
   In USER/, run mku u1; mku u2 to generate /u1 and /u2
   CONFIGURE YOUR dosemu or Vmware to have 2 serail ports at

==============================================================

                  REQUIREMENTS:

   Read the input driver code:  do_rx() and sgetc():

        do_rx() enters keys into a CIRCULAR input buffer
        sgetc() uses sleep() to wait for input chars
 
                   DO THIS :
   Modify the keyboard driver, kbd.c, to use a CIRCULAR
   input buffer, and let the process sleep() if there is
   no input char.
  
   Generate mtx with YOUR modified kbd.c.
   Boot up mtx and demonstate that your kbd driver works.
