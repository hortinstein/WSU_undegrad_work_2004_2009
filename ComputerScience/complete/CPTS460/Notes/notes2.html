<pre>                      CS460 NOTES #2

                        BOOTING
1. Booting in General:
   The process of starting up an operating system from a disk is called 
   booting or bootstrap. Different machines may have different sequence 
   of actions during booting. To be more specific, we shall consider the 
   booting sequence of PCs.

   Every PC has a ROM, which contains a set of programs called the BIOS.
   When power is turned on or following a reset, the CPU starts executing
   BIOS.  BIOS checks the system hardware, initializes itself, including 
   setting up the interrupt vectors at low memory area to point to its
   service routines.  Then, it starts to look for a device to boot. The 
   searching order is usually A:, then C: If there is a  diskette in A:, 
   BIOS will try to boot form it. Otherwise, it will try to boot from C:.

   A booter is a program that boots up itself first. Then it loads another 
   program, such as an operating system, into memory for execution. A booter 
   usually occupies the first sector (or block) of a bootable device. 
   
   Assume that there is a disk in A:  BIOS will load the very first sector
   (512 bytes) of the disk into (segment, offset)=(0x0000, 0x7C00), and jump 
   to there to executes the booter.  After this, it is entirely up to the 
   booter code to do the rest.

   In order to make room for the OS to be loaded, the booter usually relocates
   itself to a high memory area, from where it continues to load an operating
   system image into memory. When loading completes, the booter simply 
   transfers control to the OS, causing it to start up.

   Booting from a hard disk is only slightly more complex. A hard disk is 
   usually divided into several logically independent units, called 
   partitions.  The start cylinder, end cylinder and size of the partitions 
   are recorded in a Partition Table. The very first sector of a hard disk 
   is called the Master Boot Record (MBR). It contains a boot program, the 
   Partition Table, and the boot signature at the end. Each partition may 
   contain a bootable system. If so, each partition has its own booter in
   the first sector (or block) of that partition.

   During booting, BIOS will load the MBR to (0x0000, 0x7C00) as usual, and 
   turn control over to it. The MBR's boot program typically searches the 
   Partition Table for an Active partition, which is simply a partition marked
   as such. When it finds an active partition, it knows where that partition 
   begins on the disk. The MBR first relocates itself to a different memory 
   area. It then loads the boot sector of that partition to 0x7c00 and truns 
   control over to that booter. It is now up to the partition's booter to load
   and start the OS on that partition.

2. Disk I/O using BIOS:
   In order to load other programs, the booter must be able to do disk I/O.
   During booting, the only thing available is BIOS. So, you must call BIOS 
   to do I/O. In addition to getc()/putc(), BIOS also provides disk I/O 
   functions via INT 0x13. The following table shows the parameters for BIOS 
   disk I/O functions:
   =========================================================================== 
                         1.44MB

          (AL)=number of sectors to R/W   
          (AH)=2(R), 3(W), 4(Verify), 5(format), etc.

          int 0x13  ===&gt; to BIOS  
          Upon return : if (carry bit != 0) ==&gt; error.
    =========================================================================
    Notes that BIOS counts sector from 1, not 0. However, for unfiromity,we 
    shall count sector from 0. The code segment below can be used to load ONE 
    disk block into memory.
    
    .globl _diskr, _myprints
       !---------------------------------------
       ! void diskr(cyl, head, sector, buf)  parameters are on stack

        mov   bx, 10[bp]       ! BX = buf ==&gt; address = (ES,buf)
        int   0x13             ! call BIOS to read the block 
        jb    error            ! jmp to error if CarryBit on (read failed)

        mov   sp, bp
        pop   bp
        ret

        !------------------------------
        !       error &amp; reboot
        !------------------------------
    error:
        mov   bx, #bad
        push  bx
        call  _myprints
        
        int   0x19            ! reboot
    bad:      .asciz  "Error!"
===============================================================================
    You may call diskr() from C as:

                 int  cyl, head, sector;    
                 char buf[1024];

                /* COMPUTE cyl, head, sector values; then call */
    
                 diskr(cyl, head, sector, buf);

    The memory address is determined by (ES, BX). If ES is set to the same 
    segment as DS and SS, and char buf[1024] is an address in your C code,
    then buf[] is relative to DS (or SS). Thus, (ES, buf) would be the right
    REAL address of buf[].

3. Disk I/O from C:
   A disk consists of a sequence of 512-byte sectors. However, all file systems
   use disk BLOCKs as storage units. For instance, Linux uses 1KB block size 
   for floppy disk (and 4KB for HD). Thus, on a floppy disk each block consists
   of 2 consecutive sectors.

   Disk sectors or blocks are numbered sequentially as 0,1,2, ....., known as
   linear address. To load a disk block into memory, you MUST convert the block
   number blk to (cyl, head, sector), known as the CHS address. This is because
   BIOS only accepts CHS, NOT block number for FD. (EXTENDed BIOS may accept 
   linear sector address for hard drives).
.
   !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
   Figure out HOW to do the conversion. Then write C code for the function:
   !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

     int  get_block(blk, buf) 
              unsigned short blk; char *buf;
          {
             (1). Compute cyl, head, sector from blk;
                  NOTE: cyl, head, sector are all counted from 0.

             (2). diskr(cyl, head, sector, buf);
                  
             (3). return SUCCESS or FAIL;
          }

   which reads the disk block blk into buf[].

=============================================================================
                 NOTES on EXT2 file system

1. An EXT2 file system on a FD has the format:

      0     1     2      3      4       5 ........ 
    |Boot|Super|GpDes|bBitMap|iButMap| InodeBlocks | FileBlocks

 
2.  Each inode is identified by an i_number, which counts from 1. The #2 inode
    is that of the / directory. The INODE structure is shown below.

    For non-special files, (i.e. DIR or REGULAR file) the array    
                     i_block[15]  
    of each inode records the disk blocks of the file.
   
         i_block[0] to i_block[11]  are    DIRECT blocks.
         i_block[12] is the INDIRECT block, which  contains 256 block numbers.
         i_block[13] is the DOUBLE_INDIRECT block.
         i_block[14] is the TRIPLE_INDIRECT block (not applicable to FD).

    The number of actual disk blocks of a file is determined by its fileSize.
    An unused i_block[i] usually contains 0. 

3.  An EXT2 directory contains DIR entries of variable length.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

4 How to traverse the file system tree?
  Suppose we want to search for the file: 

           /boot/linux

  The steps are:

(1). Read in the GroupDescriptor 0 (in block #1) to find out where INODES 
     blocks start. (This step is optional for FD; it's always block #5).

(2). Read in the first inode block.  The second inode is the root inode.
     From the root inode:
          read in its 0th file block, which contains DIR entries
          search for the string "boot" in the DIR entries of this block;  
          if found:  { get the i_number of /sys; break;}
          else: repeat for file blocks 1, 2,..., 11
                (You may ASSUME every dir only has direct blocks).
     /* Assume  /boot  exists  AND  is a DIRectory */
     
(3). From the i_number of /sys, read in (the block containing) its
     inode. Then the situation becomes identical to that of (2).

     Thus, repeat (2) and (3) for each component of the pathname.
     The outcome is either: failed at some stage OR
                            found the inode of the file.
    
(4). From the inode of a file, we have ALL the infomation about the file.  
     In particular, we can easily find out WHERE are its disk blocks. 
     From its data blocks, we can get the file's contents.
===========================================================================
5. INODE and DIR structures:

#define u8  unsigned char
#define u16 unsigned short
#define u32 unsigned long

typedef struct ext2_inode {
	u16	i_mode;		/* File mode */
	u16	i_uid;		/* Owner Uid */
	u32	i_size;		/* Size in bytes */
	u32	i_atime;	/* Access time */
	u32	i_ctime;	/* Creation time */
	u32	i_mtime;	/* Modification time */
	u32	i_dtime;	/* Deletion Time */
	u16	i_gid;		/* Group Id */
	u16	i_links_count;	/* Links count */
	u32	i_blocks;	/* Blocks count */
	u32	i_flags;	/* File flags */
        u32     dummy;
	u32	i_block[15];    /* Pointers to blocks */
        u32     pad[7];         /* inode size MUST be 128 bytes */
} INODE;

typedef struct ext2_dir_entry_2 {
	u32	inode;			/* Inode number */
	u16	rec_len;		/* Directory entry length */
	u8	name_len;		/* Name length */
	u8	file_type;
	char	name[255];      	/* File name */
} DIR;

               CS460 NOTES #2.1 Bootable MTX Image

MTX is a samll operating system developed for CS460. It is designed to run on
Intel-based PCs in the real (unprotected) mode or any PC emulators, such as 
DOSEMU, BOCHS, VMware, etc.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    The goal of this class is to implement the MTX operating system.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
MTX can run from either a floppy disk or a hard disk partition. For simplicity
(and safety), we shall begin with MTX on floppy disks.

From the ~cs460/samples/LAB1 directory, you can download the file mtximage.gz.
Uncompress and dump it to a floppy disk by
           gunzip mtximage.gz
           dd if=mtximage of=/dev/fd0

The resulting floppy disk is a bootable MTX system composed of the following

    block0 | EXT2 file system (1 KB blocks)
    BOOTER |             /
                         |
               ------------------------
               bin  boot dev  etc  user
                     | 
                    mtx

where block0 contains a MTX booter and /boot/mtx is a bootable MTX image file.
During booting, the MTX booter is loaded into memory and runs first. It prompts
for a MTX image (file) name in the /boot directory to boot. The default image 
name is mtx. It loads the mtx image to the segment 0x1000, and then jumps to
(segment, offset)=(0x1000, 0) to start up MTX.
  

               CS460 NOTES #2.2  Bootbale Linux Image

1. Bootable Linux Image: 
   A bootable Linux image (zImage), as it exists on a floppy disk, is composed
   of the following components:

     Sector#0        : BOOT, a boot program in 16-bit machine code.
     Sector#1 to 11  : SETUP, also in 16-bit machine code;
     Sector#12 onward: Linux Kernel, about 500 KB in size.
  
2, Linux Booting Sequence:

2-1. BIOS loads BOOT:
     During booting, BIOS first loads BOOT to memory (segment) 0x07C0, and
     jumps to there to execute BOOT.

2-2. BOOT:
     BOOT first moves itself (512 bytes) from 0x07C0 to 0x9000, thus
     freeing the memory area for Linux Kernel. It then jumps (in)to 
     0x9000 to continue execution. 

     It loads  SETUP (Disk Sectors 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11) to 0x9020 AND 
               Linux Kernel (Sectors 12,13,,......)         to 0x1000.
 
     After loading completes, BOOT jumps to (0x9020, 0) to execute SETUP.

2-3. SETUP:
     SETUP sets up the starting environment for the Linux Kernel, such as
     the root device, video display mode, changing CPU from 16-bit mode 
     to 32-bit mode, etc. It then jumps to (0x1000, 0) to start up Linux.

     The above booting sequence works ONLY IF THE BOOTABLE LINUX IMAGE IS ON
     A FLOPPY DISK as described above.

     If the Linux image is STORED AS A FILE, such as /sys/linux, Linux's
     BOOT code becomes useless. (WHY?) In this case, a different boot 
     program must be used.
     
     When a linux image is stored as a file, it's easy to see that the 
     file's layout is as follows (assuming 1KB blocks):

        BOOT and SETUP would be in the file's Block#0 to Block#5,
        Linux Kernel   would be in Block#6,7,8 ...........
      
3. Another Way of Booting Linux:

   Assume that the Linux bootable image is a FILE. If we write a boot 
   program in such a way that 

   (1). it sits in the boot BLOCK of the file system so that BIOS will 
        load (512 bytes of) it to 0x07C0 during booting.

   (2), Once execution starts, it can load the entire boot program to 
        high memory, and continues in high memory. 

   (3). Then it FINDs a Linux bootable image FILE to boot. If it loads 
        the blocks of the Linux image file in exactly the same way as does 
        Linux's BOOT, i.e.

           load Linux's SETUP to 0x9020 and load Linux Kerenl to 0x1000, 
           then transfer control to Linux's SETUP,

        Linux should start up.

   With this reasoning, we shall develop such a Boot Program. 
   It should be stressed that the purpose here is NOT to write yet another 
   Linux boot program. Rather, it is intended to achieve the following 
   objectives:

   (1). Understand PC's archtecture, BIOS operations and booting;
   (2). Practice linking of assembly and C programs;
   (3). Practice file and disk I/O;
   (4). Learn to write LEAN and efficient C code.

4. Working Environment:

   When the PC starts up, it is in the so called 16-bit or unprotected 
   mode. While in this mode, it can only execute 16-bit code (and access
   1M bytes of memory).

   During booting, we must use BIOS to do I/O because there is NO operating
   system yet. BIOS functions are called by the  
               INT  #n   
   instruction, where the number n indicates which BIOS function we are 
   calling. Parameters to BIOS functions are passed in CPU registers.
   Return value is in the AX register.

   Boot programs are usually written entirely in (16-bit) assembly code
   becaue their logic is quite simple, namely, to load the disk sectors
   of an OS into memory. They do not have to know how to FIND the image 
   of an OS. 

   Based on the above discussions, a quick summary is in order:

                    During booting:

   (1). We must call BIOS functions to do I/O, so assembly code is
        un-avoidable !!!!  But this should be kept to a minimum.  

   (2). Our boot program must FIND a Linux bootable image file to load.
        For example, it may prompt for a system image to boot first.
        If the user enters the string  /sys/linux, it should boot the file
        /sys/linux. If the user enters /sys/image, it should boot that file, 
        etc.
   
        Although it is possible to write such a program in assembly, it would 
        be rather silly to do so. The major part of it should be written in C.

   (3). Linux's gcc compiler generates 32-bit code, whcih is unusable during 
        booting.  We must use a C compiler and a linker that generate 16-bit 
        machine code.

   (4). To meet these requriements, we will use bcc, as86 and ld86 package,
        which runs under Linux but generates 16-bit code for Intel processors.
