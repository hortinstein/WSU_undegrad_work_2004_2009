You know Charlie Walser? Has the place east of Sanderson?
Well you know how they used to slaughter beeves, hit 'em with a maul right here to stun 'em... and then up and slit their throats? 
Well here Charlie has one trussed up and all set to drain him and the beef comes to. 
It starts thrashing around, six hundred pounds of very pissed-off livestock if you'll pardon me... 
Charlie grabs his gun there to shoot the damn thing in the head but what with the swingin' and twistin' it's a glance-shot and ricochets around and comes back hits Charlie in the shoulder. 
You go see Charlie, he still can't reach up with his right hand for his hat... 
Point bein', even in the contest between man and steer the issue is not certain.
