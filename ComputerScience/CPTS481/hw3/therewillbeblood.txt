Ladies and gentlemen... I've traveled over half our state to be here tonight. 
I couldn't get away sooner because my new well was coming in at Coyote Hills and I had to see about it. 
That well is now flowing at two thousand barrels and it's paying me an income of five thousand dollars a week. 
I have two others drilling and I have sixteen producing at Antelope. 
So, ladies and gentlemen... if I say I'm an oil man you will agree. 
You have a great chance here, but bear in mind, you can lose it all if you're not careful. 
Out of all men that beg for a chance to drill your lots, maybe one in twenty will be oilmen; the rest will be speculators-men trying to get between you and the oilmen-to get some of the money that ought by rights come to you. 
Even if you find one that has money, and means to drill, he'll maybe known nothing about drilling and he'll have to hire out the job on contract, and then you're depending on a contractor that's trying to rush the job through so he can get another contract just as quick as he can. 
That is the way this works.

I do my own drilling and the men that work for me, work for me and they are men I know. 
I make it my business to be there and see to their work. I don't lose my tools in the hole and spend months fishing for them; I don't botch the cementing off and let water in the hole and ruin the whole lease.
I'm fixed like no other company in this field and that's because my Coyote Hills well has just come in. I have a string of tools all ready to work. 
I can load a rig onto trucks and have them here in a week.
I have business connections so I can get the lumber for the derrick; such things go by friendship in a rush like this.
And this is why I can guarantee to start drilling and put up the cash to back my word.
I assure you, whatever the others promise to do, when it comes to the showdown, they won't be there...
