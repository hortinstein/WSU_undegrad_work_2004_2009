the sri lanka python, the largest snake to be found on the island, mostly inhabits the jungles of the low country, occasionally the lower hills, but often near water. it is light brown with dark brown markings. the body is considerably thicker than in most snakes, and the snake can attain a length of 7 metres, although the average is 5 metres. the python language has nothing to do with snakes.
